        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a relatively quickly prepared dish that uses common ingredients, amd does not sacrifce deliciousness for ease of preperation. Larger fresh shrimp are ideal, but it can made more inexpensively by using small frozen cocktail shrimp, or my substituting a different protein (or be made vegetarian by skipping the protein completely, as the lemony-garlicky taste will still be quite good)</p>
