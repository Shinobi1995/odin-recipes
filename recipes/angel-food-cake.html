    <h3>Decription</h3>
    <p>This classic dessert is light bodied, not too rich, and goes great with strawberries and whipped cream.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cake flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>12 egg whites</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Clean and fully dry a 10-inch tube pan.</li>
        <li>Sift together flour, and 3/4 cup sugar, set aside.</li>
        <li>Whip egg whites, along with vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt, in a large bowl to medium stiff peaks. Gradually add remaining 3/4 cup sugar while continuing to whip to stiff peaks. When the egg white mixture has reached its maximum volume, fold in the sifted ingredients gradually, 1/3 at a time. Do not overmix. Put the batter into the tube pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cake springs back when touched, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Balance the tube pan upside down on the top of a bottle to prevent decompression while cooling. When cool, run a knife around the edge of the pan and invert onto a plate.</li>
    </ol>
